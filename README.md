# Real-time Chat Application (KleinHacks 2021)
Real-time chat application for KleinHacks

This is the example real-time chat application coded during the 2021 KleinHacks Intro to Web Development Workshop

To make this example work for yourself, you will need to replace the firebaseConfig variable on line 4 of script.js with the config values of your firebase project.

To get started with firebase, look here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#from-the-cdn
For instructions on how to populate the firebaseConfig variable to access the database, look here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart
You should be able to find any othe resources on the firebase website or google as needed.

To "run" the project, you can open index.html in a web browser, and the app should load! You can also use a hosting service to put it on the web. From there, you
can send the link to your friends and chat with them!
